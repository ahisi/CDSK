Description: Generation of chaotic attractor and fit local dimension. An
             extensible interface for continuous and discrete dynamical system
             is proposed. Orbits and snapshot of attractors can be computed,
             with a support for time dependent dynamical system. Classic chaotic
             attractors are proposed: Lorenz base, Rossler, Henon, etc.
             Furthermore, a code to compute local dimension and persistance of
             a dynamical system is proposed.
